# CZ2001 Project 1
In this project, we explored the use of different algorithms to search a DNA sequence. 

We firstly used the naive algorithm, before using the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm and finally the optimized Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm.

We also did empirical analysis and stated our findings.
